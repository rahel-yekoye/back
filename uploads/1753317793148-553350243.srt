1
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,733
Oh. Good morning, Daniel-san.

2
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,400
Morning.

3
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,904
Welcome to Miyagi
family dojo. You like?

4
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:13,072
This is really something.
Who are all these guys?

5
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,784
All of Miyagi ancestor.

6
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:16,994
And who's that?

7
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:20,498
Ah, that is Miyagi
Shimpo Sensei.

8
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:24,667
First Miyagi bring
karate to Okinawa.

9
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:28,588
Like all Miyagi, Shimpo
Sensei was fisherman.

10
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,089
Love fishing.

11
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,383
Love sake.

12
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:37,264
One day, strong wind,
strong sun, strong sake,

13
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:39,099
but no fish.

14
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,478
Shimpo Sensei fall asleep
off coast of Okinawa,

15
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:46,272
wake up off coast of China.

16
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:49,819
<i>The Han family took him in,</i>

17
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:52,863
<i>taught him art of kung fu.</i>

18
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:57,910
<i>When Sensei return to Okinawa,</i>

19
00:01:58,536 --> 00:02:00,329
<i>Miyagi karate was born.</i>

20
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:03,916
<i>Two culture, two martial art.</i>

21
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:07,418
<i>Two branches, one tree.</i>

22
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:12,299
<i>A bond that kept Hans and
Miyagis connected still today.</i>

23
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:41,954
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

24
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,849
Master Han! Master Han!

25
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:05,477
The Doctor is coming.

26
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:09,607
Stall her. Go.

27
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:11,816
Get Li!

28
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:14,278
The Doctor! Li, the Doctor!

29
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,324
The Doctor!

30
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:20,993
Welcome to Han Academy.

31
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,786
Are you looking
to learn Kung Fu?

32
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:26,247
Never too late to start
even for an old woman.

33
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:28,541
We start with jacket
on - jacket off.

34
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:32,254
Take off jacket, put on jacket.

35
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,633
I know he told you to stall me.

36
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,886
I did nothing of the sort.

37
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,056
He did ask. Sorry.

38
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:43,681
Go!

39
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:48,395
Where is my son?

40
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,814
Tea?

41
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:55,985
I'm not here for tea.

42
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,571
Where is Li?

43
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,365
Kung Fu is very empowering...

44
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:02,033
Uncle,

45
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:04,410
with all due respect.

46
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:08,290
I already lost one
son to your "path."

47
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:13,169
I will not lose another.

48
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,254
I understand.

49
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:17,465
I know what Li means to you...

50
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:20,594
but I will not have
him put in harm's way.

51
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,428
We both agree.

52
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:25,682
If you could only see
how Kung Fu helps him -

53
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:28,559
Each time life knocked me down,

54
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,146
Kung Fu helped me find my
way back to the proper path.

55
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,361
This is for you.

56
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:39,570
What's this?

57
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:41,406
I got a new position -

58
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:43,575
at a hospital in New York.

59
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:45,326
New York?

60
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:48,580
It's a chance to
restart for both of us.

61
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,458
Why two hats?

62
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,545
So you can give one to Li...

63
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:58,297
...when he finds the courage to
come out from behind your screen.

64
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,467
<i>Xiao</i> Li, I'll see you
tonight at dinner.

65
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:05,139
Very smart.

66
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,642
Your mother.

67
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:11,812
W...

68
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,193
Were you even going to ask me?

69
00:05:19,445 --> 00:05:20,685
Oh, there you are.

70
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:22,280
I'm sorry.

71
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:24,407
<i>Xiao</i> Li, would you like
to move to New York?

72
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:26,243
No, Mom, our life's here.

73
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:28,828
And how long were you gonna
keep this a secret from me?

74
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,331
And which one of us
is keeping secrets?

75
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,250
I was training. Not fighting.

76
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:37,128
You practice violence, you
get violence in return.

77
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:38,672
You of all people
should know that.

78
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:43,010
<i>Xiao</i> Li, there will be so many
other things for you in New York.

79
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:46,095
Why are you speaking
in English, Mom?

80
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,556
New city, new language.

81
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:50,350
And you can leave
all this stuff here.

82
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:55,689
Hey! Can I have your gloves?

83
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:57,983

-Sure.

106
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,004

Uh, yeah.

118
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:32,845
Do you guys have, um,
like, a stuffed crust?

119
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:37,184
No, we don't have
stuffed crust.

120
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:39,568
But you know what? I
think I can help you out.

121
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,270
You need to get
back in your car,

122
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,314
drive through the
Holland Tunnel to Jersey,

123
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:44,899
go 20 miles in any direction,

124
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,193
find yourself a nice,
crappy little strip mall,

125
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,237
and I'm sure you can
find a stuffed crust.

126
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:50,571
Are you guys done?

127
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:55,409
Hi. I apologize on
behalf of these morons.

128
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,494
Oh!

129
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:57,912
-One of whom is my dad.
-I'm a moron?

130
00:08:57,913 --> 00:09:00,081
Um, we don't have stuffed crust.

131
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:02,917
We have plain, pepperoni,
sausage and peppers,

132
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:04,961
Grandma's, Sicilian, eggplant.

133
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:07,797
Uh. Yeah. Pepperoni.
Let's do pepperoni.

134
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:09,298
Pepperoni it is. Anything else?

135
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:10,341
Toilet paper?

136
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:13,262
What? Toilet paper.

137
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:15,638
Sorry.

138
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,223
I just moved in
down the street,

139
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,183
so I'm trying to pick up
some stuff for the apartment.

140
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:20,726
Is there a place
nearby that's open?

141
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,896
Preferably one where I don't
have to drive an hour to Jersey,

142
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,617
'cause I just flew in
18 hours from Beijing.

143
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,945
Yeah, yeah. There's a
bodega around the corner.

144
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,821
-Uh...
-Convenience store.

145
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:33,281
We call them bodegas here.

146
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:37,201
Oh. Weird. Cool. Thanks.
I'll be right back.

147
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,602
Uh, can I get a
name for the order?

148
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:40,872
Yeah. Li Fong.

149
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,208
Welcome to New York, Li Fong.

150
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,126
Thanks.

151
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:46,711
What?

152
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:48,630
Since when did you
get so charming?

153
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,425
Someone in this
place needs to be.

154
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:53,176
Ouch.

155
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:58,556
Ah. School starts at 7:45 sharp.
You take the I train to...

156
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:02,101
To Union Square and then I
transfer to the Six to Canal. Yeah.

157
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,728
-And then you see Ms. Morgan.
-Ms. Morgan.

158
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:06,148
She's gonna give me the
schedule. I got it, Mom.

159
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:08,066

160
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:11,986

day at the hospital. Ready?

161
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:13,405

162
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:15,824

You know I'm good for it. It's
called professional courtesy.

184
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,234
Oh. Shit.

185
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:34,360
Your boxes are
cheaper than you are.

186
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,028
Here. Let me help
you out with these.

187
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,571
Thank you. No, it's
okay. I got it.

188
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:38,990
It's all right. Um...

189
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:41,033
I'm Li, remember?

190
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,286
From last night,
your pizza place?

191
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:46,497
Yeah, right. Stuffed crust.

192
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:48,165
-Yeah, that's me.
-Mm-hmm.

193
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,417
Stuffed crust.

194
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:52,169
Hey, um, how come your
English is so good?

195
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,880
Oh. Well, my mom did her
residency in Hong Kong,

196
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,133
so I went to an American
school while I was there.

197
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:58,468
Mmm.

198
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:02,973
What, and now you're
slumming it here with me?

199
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:05,724
Yeah. Yeah.

200
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:09,645
Okay. Um...

201
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:11,064
Well, thank you.

202
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:13,482
I think I got it from here.

203
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,443
That's all right. I'm
not doing anything.

204
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:18,070
Are you sure? I do have
a couple more stops.

205
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,823
Yeah. Seriously, no problem.

206
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,577
Made that many new
friends today, huh, Li?

207
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:28,081
-Yeah, well, you know, day's not over yet.
-Okay.

208
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:31,041
I, uh...

209
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,586
<i>Wait, like, this is so
heavy. These tomatoes...</i>

210
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:36,464
Yeah, dude, it's really nice not
having to carry it all by myself.

211
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:38,592
-Why are they so heavy?
-This is great for me.

212
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:41,302
Okay. We got aprons.
We got sauce.

213
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:43,387
Now we just need to hit
kitchen supply, and then...

214
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,267
Crap.

215
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:52,438
You study karate or something?

216
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,107
Yeah, kung fu. I used to.

217
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,902
It's cool, but, um...

218
00:12:57,903 --> 00:12:59,488
yeah, don't do any
of that anymore.

219
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:02,317
Yeah, you're clearly over it.

220
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,116
Just don't train here, okay?

221
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,077
-Why not?
-'Cause you can't.

222
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:08,204
Mia.

223
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,831
Long time no see.

224
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:12,501
Not long enough.

225
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:15,086
Tell your dad he owes me a call.

226
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:17,546
Tell him yourself, O'Shea.

227
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:20,050
I tried. Your old
man don't listen.

228
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,219
Guess I'm a chip off
the old block, then.

229
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,387
Gotta go.

230
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:27,223
Who's that guy?

231
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:28,390
He owns that gym.

232
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,768
My dad owes him some
money. All right?

233
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:33,480
Just stay off this block
and you'll be fine, okay?

234
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:35,856
One more stop.

235
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,903
Looking good,
Conor. Looking fast.

236
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:44,698
You know, I just saw your
girl, Mia, out there.

237
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:46,910
Looks like she's moving
on pretty fast, too.

238
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,082
What are you laughing at?

239
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,834
What? It was funny.

240
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:58,922
You're right.

241
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,174
I need to lighten up.

242
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,804
Oh, shit.

243
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,515

00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:22,987
1200 new.

250
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:24,823
Okay. Forget it. Just these.

251
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:40,921
What are you doing?

252
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:43,049
She's gonna give
it to you for 450.

253
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:45,802
-What? What happened to 600?
-Mm-hmm.

254
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:50,431
She didn't know that your
boyfriend was from Beijing.

255
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,310
-Wow.
-Yeah.

256
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:57,938
Mm-kay. Look at you. You're
so proud of yourself, huh?

257
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:59,189
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

258
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,735
You think you're my boyfriend now 'cause
you got me 150 off a replacement blower?

259
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:05,112
Uh, no. No. I'm way
harder to get than that.

260
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:07,114
-Oh, okay. Really?
-Uh-huh.

261
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:09,158
But I could teach
you some Mandarin.

262
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:13,370
I'm serious. If you went in there and
you started speaking their language,

263
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:16,040
you would get so much respect.
They'd give you the local discount.

264
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,249
I am the local.

265
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,584
Not in their shop, you're not.

266
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:20,086
And in return?

267
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,131
I don't know. Um, you
teach me New York.

268
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:25,382
-Teach you New York?
-Yeah.

269
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:26,467
-What?
-Yes.

270
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:28,510
Dude, what? Look around.

271
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,638
New York is completely
unteachable.

272
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,848
Well, they say the same
thing about Mandarin, right?

273
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,520
Okay. Fine.

274
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:39,855
I get off work early on Sunday.

275
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:41,566
I can show you a few
spots around town.

276
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:44,653
-Okay.
-Okay.

277
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:48,489
What? What does that mean?

278
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,865
It's a date!

279
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:53,160
Uh, no. It's not a date.

280
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:55,497
It's an educational experience!

281
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,917
How was school?

282
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:01,335
Uh...

283
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:04,881
It was good. Yeah.
You know, it's school.

284
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:09,344
You make any friends?

285
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:11,888
Um...

286
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,600
Yeah, I did. One, I think.

287
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,270
Good. What's his name?

288
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,314
Mia.

289
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,361
-Mia?
-Mm-hmm.

290
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:37,080
You know how to ride
a scooter, right?

291
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:42,292
You've driven a
scooter before, right?

292
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,128
Nah. First time.

293
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,552
Look, there's Simu Liu.

294
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:54,389
Twins.

295
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:03,481
-Whoa, whoa!
-Hang on, Stuffed Crust.

296
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,701
Ugh, come on. Are
you kidding me?

297
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:16,785
What's wrong?

298
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:17,996
The engine's shot.

299
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:20,372
Okay. So, how do we get home?

300
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:26,795
-No.
-No, no.

301
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,926
Yeah.

302
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,636
-Perfect.
-You're messing with me.

303
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:38,016
No. No. It's actually...
I'm shocked, actually. Yeah.

304
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,602
-Great.
-What?

305
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:43,479
Hey, beautiful.

306
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,564
Hi, Conor.

307
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:47,025
What a pleasant surprise.

308
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:48,776
What's this?

309
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:49,944
Engine died.

310
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:53,114
-Who's your friend?
-Hi. Li.

311
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,616
Conor, don't start.

312
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:56,826
Don't start what?

313
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,161
Where you from, Li?

314
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:02,707
Beijing.

315
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,251
You know kung fu?

316
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,961
Uh...

317
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:10,840
Little.

318
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:15,177
Okay, Conor, you can
keep walking now.

319
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:16,970
We're just trying to get
home. It's been a long day.

320
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:19,307
Oh, so you guys are
a "we" now, huh?

321
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:22,185
See, I didn't even know we
were done. Here you are.

322
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:26,438
Okay, um, this has been really
fun, but we're going to go.

323
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,276
Move.

324
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,028
Why should I?

325
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,447
'Cause she asked you to.

326
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:38,034
Li...

327
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:47,252
No, you guys are right. My bad.

328
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:51,213
Come on, let's
let the lady pass.

329
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:53,465
<i>...doors, please. Stand
clear of the doors.</i>

330
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,717
<i>Next stop, 23rd Street.</i>

331
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,219
Heads up!

332
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,303
Li!

333
00:18:58,304 --> 00:18:59,680
Conor!

334
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:00,764
Oh, God!

335
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:02,599
-Later, Mia.
-Good one, bro.

336
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,394
Dude, I'm so sorry.

337
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,228
Conor's a psycho.

338
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:11,233
He's kind of the low point
of my teenage rebellion.

339
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:15,029
In my defense, he wasn't such a dick
until he started training at that gym.

340
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:17,656
You just... You can't
step to guys like him.

341
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:21,326
He practices karate, like, 24-7.
He wins the 5 Boroughs every year.

342
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,911
What's the 5 Boroughs?

343
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:27,250
It's this insane karate tournament
on the streets all around the city.

344
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,626
You get big prize
money if you win.

345
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:32,629
But don't get any
ideas, Mr. Kung Fu.

346
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:37,050
My dad told me a thousand times
not to get involved with him.

347
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,802
So, why did you?

348
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,471
'Cause he told me not to.

349
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:45,601
How's your eye? Can I see it?

350
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:46,686
Sure.

351
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:49,563
-Hmm.
-What?

352
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:51,023
-Hmm. Mm-mmm, mm-mmm.
-What?

353
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:53,401
-Is it really bad?
-No, it's... It's, well...

354
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,194
-Yeah.
-Oh.

355
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,281
Oh! What happened
to Stuffed Crust?

356
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:00,658
Can you help him?

357
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:06,413
This is definitely going to
sting for a couple of days.

358
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:07,915
Ooh, ooh. Don't move.

359
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,792
So, where'd you learn
how to do makeup?

360
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,961
-My wife.
-She taught you?

361
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:16,132
No. No, for nights like this.

362
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,676
She didn't much like
me fighting either.

363
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:20,970
Let me see.

364
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,806
Yeah, I think that'll work.

365
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:26,100
Okay, from now on...

366
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:30,021
keep your guard up.
Hands like this.

367
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,607
Hmm. Sure.

368
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:34,817
Take a look.

369
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,322
Wow.

370
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,952
So... how long have
you been fighting?

371
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:46,036
Too long.

372
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:49,039
-He was the best in the city once.
-Yeah.

373
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,042
Now I'm doing
makeup on teenagers.

374
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,338
Ice it before bed, and then sleep
with a tea bag on it tonight.

375
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:57,215
Green? Black?

376
00:20:58,341 --> 00:20:59,676
Lipton.

377
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,181
What are you doing?

378
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:09,185
You come to America.
No fighting.

379
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,437
It was a simple rule.

380
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:15,483
I didn't have a choice.

381
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:17,777
You always have a choice.

382
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:22,532
Get dressed.

383
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:44,803
Um, who is this person?

384
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,930
Your tutor for the SATs.

385
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:48,016
Enjoy your day.

386
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:57,942
What's so funny?

387
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:01,748
Your mom thinks you're going to get
into NYU with these calc skills.

388
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:05,240
Yeah, well, I wouldn't be
laughing if I were you.

389
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:06,909
Have you met my mom?

390
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,290
Did she do that to your eye?

391
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:53,289
<i>All right, Li. Dragon Kick.</i>

392
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:01,214
Oh my god!

393
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:05,050
See the run up is key.

394
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:06,927
But the balance and the
jump, that's what sells it.

395
00:23:06,928 --> 00:23:08,346
Now you try.

396
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:18,356
I don't think I'm going
to master this one.

397
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:22,318
You will. One day,
when you need it.

398
00:23:40,545 --> 00:23:42,004
Yo, Beijing.

399
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:45,216
How's the eye? Looks like
it's healing up nice.

400
00:23:45,842 --> 00:23:47,552
Hey, don't walk away from me.

401
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:52,722
You know the first
rule of karate, right?

402
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:54,392
You always keep your guard up.

403
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,855
Ooh!

404
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,402
You really want to
do this, Beijing?

405
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,989
I'll take it easy
on you. No hands.

406
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:28,801
That was crazy as hell!

407
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:32,221
-Do not get up.
-Stay down!

408
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:39,187
<i>The Dragon Kick.</i>

409
00:24:41,731 --> 00:24:43,523
See the run up is key.

410
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:52,282
Ooh!

411
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:54,034
Oh, is that all
you got, Beijing?

412
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:55,368
-That's enough!
-That's enough.

413
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:00,373
Hey, you actually want
to fight, Beijing?

414
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:03,044
Fight me in the 5 Boroughs
where no one can save your ass.

415
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:05,545
-Hey, get off me!
-Let's go.

416
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:07,340
Show's over, folks!

417
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:13,072
Huh.

418
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:16,241
What we got here?

419
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:17,910
Yo, kid, get on out of here.

420
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:20,162
Hey, fellas.

421
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:24,625
Why don't we let
the kid go home?

422
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:28,295
And we can settle whatever it is
O'Shea sent you here to settle.

423
00:26:28,296 --> 00:26:29,462
Yeah.

424
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:32,758
Victor, look out!

425
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,805
Victor!

426
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:40,224
I told you, kid.

Let's go! And you
better pay up, Victor!

439
00:27:55,383 --> 00:27:57,134
And I thought I was
going to rescue you.

440
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,850
Here, helps with the healing.

441
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:11,399
Mmm.

442
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:13,150
Whoa.

443
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:16,031
So, you want to tell me
what that was out there?

444
00:28:17,238 --> 00:28:18,447
I used to train kung fu.

445
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:21,032
-Would you teach it?
-To who?

446
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:22,868
Me.

447
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:28,624
I took a loan from the kind of people
you don't want to borrow money from.

448
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:32,128
Now the loan is due, I can't pay,
and that was them coming to collect.

449
00:28:33,254 --> 00:28:34,463
They're not going to stop.

450
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:38,175
So, what are you going to do?

451
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:41,595
I used to be good.

452
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:45,474
-Best in the city at one point, Li.
-Wow.

453
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:48,185
{\an8}So, what happened?

454
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:51,897
Mia happened. Best
thing to ever happen.

455
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:57,026
But it did catch me by surprise,
so... Needed something steady.

456
00:28:57,027 --> 00:29:00,030
Traded in the gloves for the
apron, and the rest is history.

457
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:05,786
Most people don't know the moment
their life changed forever.

458
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:08,329
I get to see mine every day.

459
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:12,793
Look.

460
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,213
I know a guy. Promotes
fights around the city.

461
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:19,007
He's going to set me
up with a prize fight

462
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:21,384
with a purse big enough I can
pay my debt, keep the shop,

463
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:23,511
maybe even have a little
left over to pay for college.

464
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:26,431
-Listen, Victor, I can't help...
-Li,

465
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:28,559
I ain't got a shot
to win unless...

466
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:32,312
you teach me what you know.

467
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:34,898
The speed, the
flexibility, how you move.

468
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:35,983
I can't.

469
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:37,818
Why not?

470
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:40,904
Because I made a promise that
I wouldn't fight anymore.

471
00:29:40,905 --> 00:29:44,324
I'm just... trying
very hard to keep it.

472
00:29:44,325 --> 00:29:46,368
But you're not fighting. I am.

473
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:49,246
Right.

474
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,168
Look, um...

475
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:59,131
I also know the moment that
my life changed forever.

476
00:30:01,217 --> 00:30:03,385
And I replay it over
and over in my head.

477
00:30:17,525 --> 00:30:18,858
Here. Let me help.

478
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:19,984
No, I got it.

479
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:22,029
-I got it, Mom.
-Mmm.

480
00:30:25,074 --> 00:30:27,158
I don't understand why I
have to go to this thing.

481
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:28,827
Never went to a temple in China.

482
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:31,454
New city, new traditions.

483
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:32,539
Mmm.

484
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:35,834
You look good.

485
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:37,335
Thanks.

486
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:52,101
I miss him.

487
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,696
<i>Mmm?</i>

488
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:06,990
Hey, <i>Shifu</i>. It's Li.

489
00:31:06,991 --> 00:31:08,866
How are you, Li?

490
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,995
Are we loving New York yet?

491
00:31:11,996 --> 00:31:14,581
More missing Beijing.

492
00:31:14,582 --> 00:31:16,374
The school misses you too.

493
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,584
Wait a minute...

494
00:31:17,585 --> 00:31:18,668
Say hi!

495
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:20,045
<i>Xiao</i> Li!

496
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,547
Shifu...

497
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:23,798
<i>Ah.</i>

498
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:27,051
I've made a new friend here

499
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:30,931
who asked me to
teach him Kung Fu.

500
00:31:32,016 --> 00:31:33,057
I see.

501
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:37,396
Do you think Kung Fu
can help your friend?

502
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:39,272
I think so.

503
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:42,442
Anything that helps others and
benefits yourself is a good thing.

504
00:31:42,443 --> 00:31:44,945
<i>Sharing your knowledge
is a good thing.</i>

505
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:47,030
Hey! What can I get ya?

506
00:31:47,031 --> 00:31:48,157
You're old.

507
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:51,909
And you're slow. And
your footwork's sloppy.

508
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,412
-Anything else?
-Yeah.

509
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:55,747
You take more punches
than you throw,

510
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:57,957
which I feel like you think
that's a talent, but it's not.

511
00:31:57,958 --> 00:31:59,501
So what are you doing here?

512
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:01,211
I can make you better.

513
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:03,005
When do we start?

514
00:32:06,467 --> 00:32:08,969
All right. Let's just do a
three-minute round, yeah?

515
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,929
Full speed. Just try to hit
me however you think you can.

516
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:15,433
Li, you're half my size.

517
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:16,893
I gotta see what you're
like in the ring.

518
00:32:16,894 --> 00:32:20,271
Oh, come on. I'm not
fighting a 150-pound kid.

519
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:21,774
Well, you're not.

520
00:32:22,358 --> 00:32:23,691
I'm 125.

521
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:37,288
There's no kicks in boxing.

522
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,832
Learn to duck.

523
00:32:46,674 --> 00:32:48,675
Since when do we close
at eight o'clock?

524
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:59,143
Have you lost your mind? You're
gonna fight again? Really?

525
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:00,561
And you're gonna train him?

526
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:02,897
-It was his idea.
-He saved my ass the other night.

527
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:05,900
Yeah, you told me. He's the
Chinese Peter Parker. I don't care.

528
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:08,111
He can show me what he knows.
Keep me light on my feet.

529
00:33:08,112 --> 00:33:10,947
You haven't been light on your
feet since you were 19, Dad.

530
00:33:10,948 --> 00:33:12,491
Which is exactly why I need him.

531
00:33:15,536 --> 00:33:17,495
You know you're giving
him false hope, right?

532
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:18,872
Better than no hope.

533
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:23,918
-Are you sure about that?
-Honey, it's one fight. Maybe two.

534
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,004
-Uh...
-I can do this, Mia.

535
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:29,466
Uh...

536
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:31,927
Unbelievable.

537
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,597
He gets his ass kicked,
that's on you. You hear me?

538
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:37,640
Yes. Yeah.

539
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:39,434
I think the whole
neighborhood heard you.

540
00:33:39,435 --> 00:33:40,601
Good.

541
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:42,645
Then we're all on the same page.

542
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:45,649
Now if you'll excuse me, apparently,
I have a pizza shop to run.

543
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,613
That went well.

544
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:57,702
everything is kung fu.

545
00:34:04,001 --> 00:34:05,169
This shop is kung fu.

546
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:09,631
Boxing's kung fu.

547
00:34:13,427 --> 00:34:14,511
Give me your arm.

548
00:34:17,014 --> 00:34:18,055
Lower.

549
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,432
Wrong side. Around.

550
00:34:19,433 --> 00:34:21,018
Punch. One, two, three, four.

551
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:26,022
Horse stance...

552
00:34:26,023 --> 00:34:28,191
Oh! Ooh.

553
00:34:28,192 --> 00:34:30,568
...teaches control
over the mind...

554
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,236
-...so that you can overcome the pain.
-Mm-hmm.

555
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:33,738
You're gonna be
making pizzas all day,

556
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:35,948
you gotta be training while
you're making those pizzas.

557
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:38,242
I make a hundred pies a day.
I know how to make pizza, Li.

558
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:39,453
Cool.

559
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:42,998
Show me.

560
00:34:45,793 --> 00:34:47,211
Squat. Don't bend.

561
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:49,921
How long am I supposed
to stay like this?

562
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:52,007
I'm going to lunch.
See you in an hour.

563
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:54,050
Okay.

564
00:34:54,051 --> 00:34:56,010
<i>You got long arms, but
when you're in close,</i>

565
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:57,971
<i>you're not gonna always
have room to swing it.</i>

566
00:34:58,555 --> 00:35:02,350
<i>You're gonna have to learn to deliver
power without moving your body.</i>

567
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:03,711
<i>This is called the
one-inch punch.</i>

568
00:35:04,937 --> 00:35:06,313
Try it.

569
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:10,400
Don't worry so much about power.

570
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:14,112
Just focus on
snapping the wrist.

571
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,752
<i>We're turning you from
a stone to a stream.</i>

572
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:33,714
<i>You strike a stone,
eventually it breaks.</i>

573
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:36,134
<i>You strike water,
it keeps moving.</i>

574
00:35:36,677 --> 00:35:38,887
<i>Always flowing, always fluid.</i>

575
00:35:40,556 --> 00:35:41,682
Order up.

576
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,018
All right. I got
a large plain pie.

577
00:35:47,688 --> 00:35:49,523
Victory Pizza. What can
I get for you, boss?

578
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:51,566
What?

579
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:53,359
You sound more New
York than I do.

580
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,570
...but downtown
price is lower.

581
00:35:55,571 --> 00:35:56,988
Please?

582
00:35:58,073 --> 00:35:59,448
Okay, okay... ...take it.

583
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:00,576
Thank you.

584
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:04,245
Let's do something fun.

585
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:06,163
Yeah!

586
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,958
-What about Li?
-Li is, uh...

587
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:10,669
One more time.

588
00:36:26,393 --> 00:36:27,394
Time.

589
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:29,354
What do you think?

590
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,149
You might actually
survive a fight or two.

591
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:20,821
<i>♪ We all big time Face on

00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:23,325

00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:33,626
Oh, sorry.

598
00:37:33,627 --> 00:37:34,710
Sorry. Um...

599
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,215
Didn't think anyone
would be here.

600
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:41,968
I got a loan shark, a teenage
daughter and a fight in two days.

601
00:37:41,969 --> 00:37:43,219
What's your excuse?

602
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,347
I couldn't sleep.

603
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:48,599
So you always beat the shit out of
yourself in the middle of the night?

604
00:37:50,978 --> 00:37:52,187
You wanna talk about it?

605
00:37:56,441 --> 00:38:00,570
There's a old Chinese
tradition when someone dies.

606
00:38:01,822 --> 00:38:05,366
You're supposed to open
all the doors and windows

607
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:07,910
and literally sweep all
the death out of your house

608
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:09,745
so that everyone else
can go on living.

609
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:15,502
If only it were
that easy, right?

610
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:25,345
My brother and I got
attacked about a year ago.

611
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:29,808
It was, um, after a big
tournament in Beijing.

612
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,226
<i>My brother won,</i>

613
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:36,397
<i>but the guy he beat
wanted revenge. So...</i>

614
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:40,444
...he got a couple of
guys, and they cornered us.

615
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:44,364
<i>We were outnumbered.</i>

616
00:38:51,747 --> 00:38:53,206
<i>One of them pulled a knife.</i>

617
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:57,376
<i>Xiao</i> Li!

618
00:38:58,462 --> 00:38:59,920
<i>Bo was screaming
for me to help him.</i>

619
00:39:01,882 --> 00:39:02,882
<i>I froze.</i>

620
00:39:14,061 --> 00:39:15,937
Now I'm here, and
he's not. So, yeah.

621
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:18,147
<i>I let him down.</i>

622
00:39:25,322 --> 00:39:27,741
You're gonna have to let
yourself off the hook, Li.

623
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:31,912
You deal with it, or
it's gonna deal with you.

624
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:38,794
Yeah.

625
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:49,053
Free pizza, freshly made.

626
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:50,555
Thank you.

627
00:39:51,515 --> 00:39:53,140
Is she making fun of me?

628
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:54,433
Is it... Is it my cardigan?

629
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:58,438
No, Alan. I don't know enough
Mandarin to make fun of you.

630
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:00,357
Oh.

631
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:03,735
So, are you guys going
to San Gennaro later?

632
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,696
I don't think I can.

633
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:09,406
I actually have to study
for this test coming up.

634
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,491
I think my mom's on to me.

635
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:13,994
Come on. Don't be lame.

636
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:16,789
Li, just come. It's like a
New York rite of passage.

637
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:17,958
Yeah. Uh...

638
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:20,794
Oh.

639
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:23,504
And you're crushing
calculus, by the way.

640
00:40:23,505 --> 00:40:25,548
See? You have to come.

641
00:40:25,549 --> 00:40:26,842
We'll be there.

642
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:29,928
Okay, maybe.

643
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,598
Okay. Then maybe I
will see you tonight.

644
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:40,063
Dude, you are so in.

645
00:40:40,856 --> 00:40:43,483
Okay, we're just friends.

646
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:46,528
Also, am I really
crushing calculus?

647
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:49,196
No. No, this is all wrong.

648
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,491
I was just trying to
make you look good. Yeah.

649
00:40:57,539 --> 00:40:59,207
Ciao. Ciao, ciao.

650
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:03,294
Ciao. Did you decide how you're
gonna make your move tonight?

651
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:05,087
I'm not making a move, Alan.

652
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:07,923
No, no, no, no, no. Tonight is
the night to make a move, man.

653
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:11,093
It's got everything. Music,
romance, sausage, peppers.

654
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:13,220
Cotton candy.

655
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:15,390
Oh.

656
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:28,695
You smell that, man?

657
00:41:29,446 --> 00:41:31,155
Love is in the air.

658
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:33,782
What else? Let me have a bite.

659
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:35,619
-Okay, I will.
-It looks good.

660
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:37,287
Who's that guy?

661
00:41:39,581 --> 00:41:41,374
Told you we were just friends.

662
00:41:49,216 --> 00:41:54,386
<i>The winner of the fight at
1:22 of the second round.</i>

663
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:59,350
<i>Winner by TKO, Hoagie
"Cheap Shot" Parker.</i>

664
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:02,645
All right, Lipani, you're up
next. Five minutes. Let's go.

665
00:42:02,646 --> 00:42:03,813
Got the ice.

666
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:05,815
Do we need anything else?

667
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:08,568
Li?

668
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,571
Why are you ignoring me?

669
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:14,406
I'm not.

670
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:16,409
Yes, you are.

671
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:19,328
I'm already really nervous
and stressed about tonight,

672
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:20,705
and your weirdness
is not helping.

673
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:24,333
I'm working your dad's corner
tonight, not yours, so...

674
00:42:24,334 --> 00:42:26,253
let's just focus on that, okay?

675
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:29,464
No. Not okay.

676
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:31,174
Li?

677
00:42:34,094 --> 00:42:35,511
What's going on with you?

678
00:42:35,512 --> 00:42:36,596
I don't know.

679
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:38,848
Why don't you ask Conor?

680
00:42:39,933 --> 00:42:41,225
What is that supposed to mean?

681
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:43,186
You two seemed pretty
close last night.

682
00:42:44,938 --> 00:42:46,106
At San Gennaro.

683
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:49,108
Alan and I showed up for a bit.

684
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,445
That's what this is about.

685
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:55,572
Look, Li, it's
complicated, but...

686
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,033
It's fine. I get it.

687
00:43:00,203 --> 00:43:03,080
Actually, no, I don't
get it. Explain it to me.

688
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:06,501
He doesn't deserve you,
Mia. Not even a little bit.

689
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:13,173
You know how sometimes you
have those dumb mistakes

690
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:15,592
that you just keep making
over and over again?

691
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:18,679
And it's like you don't even really
want to keep making them, but...

692
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:21,641
you do because it's there
and it's easy and...

693
00:43:22,434 --> 00:43:24,351
-Last night...
-Actually, I'm good. I don't want to...

694
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:28,064
Last night was not one
of those nights. Okay?

695
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:30,149
He wanted it to be,

696
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:33,903
but I told him that I'm done making
those same mistakes with him because...

697
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:38,950
because I met someone that I
want to make new mistakes with.

698
00:43:40,577 --> 00:43:41,953
So...

699
00:43:42,704 --> 00:43:44,706
is that what we're doing?
We're making mistakes?

700
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:47,334
Best way to learn.

701
00:43:50,587 --> 00:43:52,588
Oh, my God! Really?

702
00:43:52,589 --> 00:43:54,465
-We were just...
-We were talking about strategies...

703
00:43:54,466 --> 00:43:55,758
And on fight night.

704
00:43:55,759 --> 00:43:57,677
I... I don't want to hear it.

705
00:43:58,428 --> 00:44:00,721
You're just lucky I have someone
else to knock out tonight.

706
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:13,776
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
live from Queens...</i>

707
00:44:13,777 --> 00:44:15,486
This your plan to pay me back?

708
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:17,446
Wouldn't bet against me, O'Shea.

709
00:44:17,447 --> 00:44:20,115
I already have.
My money's on him.

710
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:23,619
<i>In the blue corner, we
have former welterweight...</i>

711
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,746
Dad, if you're having second
thoughts, we can still back out.

712
00:44:25,747 --> 00:44:27,164
You don't have to go
through with this.

713
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:28,874
I'm not having second
thoughts, kiddo.

714
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:30,502
Then why are we standing here?

715
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:32,836
'Cause you're supposed
to get the ropes.

716
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:34,631
Oh, right. Sorry.

717
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,758
<i>And in the red corner,</i>

718
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,718
<i>we have the challenger,</i>

719
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:44,098
<i>the pride of North Brooklyn,
former Golden Gloves champ...</i>

720
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:45,182
Sorry.

721
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:49,479
<i>...Victor Lipani!</i>

722
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:58,696
All right.

723
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:04,827
I want a clean fight.
No elbows, no low blows,

724
00:45:04,828 --> 00:45:07,205
and if I tell you
to break, you break.

725
00:45:07,831 --> 00:45:09,164
Gloves.

726
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:10,458
Welcome back to boxing.

727
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:16,171
Remember. Flow. Don't
anchor the hips.

728
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:18,425
Tonight you're water, not stone.

729
00:45:19,634 --> 00:45:21,386
You look scared to death, kiddo.

730
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:24,681
I'm not scared. I'm fine.
This is how I always look.

731
00:45:26,141 --> 00:45:27,183
I got this.

732
00:45:30,437 --> 00:45:31,938
Box!

733
00:45:35,275 --> 00:45:37,192
-Yes, yes, yes!
-Go on, Victor! Keep moving!

734
00:45:38,278 --> 00:45:39,487
Whoo!

735
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:43,616
You got it, Dad! You got it!

736
00:45:53,001 --> 00:45:55,586
Knock his head off!
Stop playing with him!

737
00:45:55,587 --> 00:45:56,795
-Keep going! Come on!
-Come on!

738
00:45:56,796 --> 00:45:58,256
You got this, Victor!

739
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:01,341
Keep it loose. Keep
the pressure on him.

740
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:03,635
Don't trade blows. You're
taking too many hits out there.

741
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:06,097
Slips that hook. Watch
that one, all right?

742
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:09,975
This guy doesn't stop swinging.

743
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:12,311
You're the better fighter in
that ring. You've got this.

744
00:46:12,312 --> 00:46:14,314
Stay focused. Don't
let him back you up.

745
00:46:15,023 --> 00:46:16,524
Use the one-inch punch, Victor!

746
00:46:18,902 --> 00:46:19,986
Yes!

747
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:22,947
Go.

748
00:46:25,825 --> 00:46:27,160
Yes, yes! Come on!

749
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:30,746
Let's go!

750
00:46:30,747 --> 00:46:31,831
-Yes!
-Yes!

751
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:34,583
-Let's go, Dad!
-Keep the footwork up.

752
00:46:34,584 --> 00:46:36,585
-Low, Victor!
-Take him down!

753
00:46:42,217 --> 00:46:43,926
-Get over it!
-Stay in control.

754
00:46:43,927 --> 00:46:45,470
Come on!

755
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:47,555
-Yes! Yes! Yes!
-Let's go!

756
00:46:49,641 --> 00:46:50,934
Yes!

757
00:46:58,149 --> 00:46:59,858
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Illegal blow!

758
00:46:59,859 --> 00:47:02,194
-Illegal! Ref, what the hell?
-Hey, that's elbows!

759
00:47:02,195 --> 00:47:03,403
-He can't do that!
-Stop!

760
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:04,738
Gentlemen, break it up!

761
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:06,281
-Yes! Break his face!
-He can't do that!

762
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:07,950
-Illegal blow!
-Knock him out!

763
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:16,167
Dad!

764
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:19,670
Dad?

765
00:47:19,671 --> 00:47:21,339
Somebody! I need help!

766
00:47:23,508 --> 00:47:24,509
Dad!

767
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:32,016
Li!

768
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,727
Do something! Li!

769
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:41,816
Let's get him inside right now.
Code blue. Code blue, everyone.

770
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:43,444
Out the way. Out the way.

771
00:47:59,127 --> 00:48:01,253
Li? Li, what are
you doing? Come on.

772
00:48:01,254 --> 00:48:02,755
<i>Xiao</i> Li!

773
00:48:03,339 --> 00:48:04,465
Li, we need you.

774
00:48:17,562 --> 00:48:18,979
<i>How do you know this man?</i>

775
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,397
I was training him to fight.

776
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:21,898
<i>Xiao</i> Li.

777
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:23,901
I thought I was clear.

778
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:26,738
No fighting.

779
00:48:29,324 --> 00:48:31,909
I have to try to keep
your friend alive.

785
00:50:50,298 --> 00:50:52,299
-<i>Shifu!</i>
-Now you see me, huh?

786
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,552
Go!

787
00:50:57,346 --> 00:50:59,474
-Hey, Mom.
-Hi!

788
00:51:00,016 --> 00:51:01,476
Surprise.

789
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,021
So...

790
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:08,191
this is life in
the big city, huh?

791
00:51:16,324 --> 00:51:18,576
I love your new home. Very hip.

792
00:51:20,036 --> 00:51:21,329
Why are you here?

793
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:25,291
I just feel like the
right time to visit.

794
00:51:59,951 --> 00:52:03,663
You cannot control when life
knocks you down, <i>Xiao</i> Li.

795
00:52:04,247 --> 00:52:07,708
But you can control
when to get back up.

796
00:52:11,963 --> 00:52:13,840
We'll go to see your
friend tomorrow.

797
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:17,051
Tidy this room.

798
00:52:20,972 --> 00:52:21,973
Good catch.

799
00:52:23,516 --> 00:52:24,684
Go.

800
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:30,647
Hey.

801
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:35,111
Mia...

802
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:38,405
Oh, uh, Victor, this is Mr. Han.

803
00:52:38,406 --> 00:52:40,407
Hey, the legendary <i>Shifu.</i>

804
00:52:40,408 --> 00:52:41,742
Li's been singing your praises.

805
00:52:42,368 --> 00:52:44,160
Victor, I'm so sorry
about everything.

806
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:45,996
Kid, it's not your fault.

807
00:52:45,997 --> 00:52:47,707
Yeah, but the shop.

808
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,126
That's not your responsibility.

809
00:52:51,127 --> 00:52:54,087
And, who knows, maybe it's time
for us to move someplace warm.

810
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:55,714
You can't do that, Victor.

811
00:52:55,715 --> 00:52:58,133
You'd be walking away from
everything that you've built.

812
00:52:58,134 --> 00:52:59,342
It's not walking away.

813
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:01,052
It's moving on.

814
00:53:03,306 --> 00:53:05,725
Ah. Chinese saying:

815
00:53:06,267 --> 00:53:08,853
"Friend's problem
is my problem."

816
00:53:09,562 --> 00:53:10,897
We will find a way to help.

817
00:53:14,567 --> 00:53:16,651
What was that? How
are we gonna help?

818
00:53:16,652 --> 00:53:19,738
Tournament start in ten
days. You will fight.

819
00:53:19,739 --> 00:53:20,907
I'm gonna what?

820
00:53:21,741 --> 00:53:24,075
In two days, you find
us a place to train.

821
00:53:24,076 --> 00:53:25,411
And where are you going?

822
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:27,871
I'm going to see my friend.

823
00:53:27,872 --> 00:53:29,456
Hey! Where you walking?

824
00:53:29,457 --> 00:53:30,541
Sorry.

825
00:53:31,042 --> 00:53:32,751
Wait. You're gonna what?

828
00:53:52,063 --> 00:53:53,146
Hello?

829
00:53:58,235 --> 00:53:59,320
Hello?

830
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:14,043
Hello, old friend.

831
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:17,463
It's been a long time.

832
00:54:28,933 --> 00:54:30,017
Excuse me.

833
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:34,230
You, uh, knew Mr. Miyagi?

834
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:37,399
Last time we spoke,

835
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:40,318
he said if I ever
needed his help,

836
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:41,862
I knew where to find him.

837
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:45,116
I'm so sorry to tell you
this, but Mr. Miyagi, he...

838
00:54:45,741 --> 00:54:47,409
passed away years ago.

839
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:48,536
I know.

840
00:54:49,912 --> 00:54:52,373
I did not come looking
for Sensei Miyagi.

841
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,668
I don't understand.

842
00:54:58,212 --> 00:54:59,714
I came looking for you.

843
00:55:01,549 --> 00:55:02,675
Look at you two.

844
00:55:03,718 --> 00:55:04,968
Wow.

845
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:09,014
We took this picture in 1985.

846
00:55:09,015 --> 00:55:11,100
Right here in this house.

847
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:15,062
He spent the whole
night talking about you.

848
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:16,939
His best friend.

849
00:55:18,065 --> 00:55:21,443
The boy who put
purpose in his life.

850
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:28,117
I appreciate you coming all
this way, Mr. Han, but I...

851
00:55:28,701 --> 00:55:32,203
My life now, I can't just
pack up and head to New York.

852
00:55:32,204 --> 00:55:35,165
I mean, there's
plenty of good dojos.

853
00:55:35,166 --> 00:55:38,878
Yes. But I don't want
Li to learn karate.

854
00:55:40,588 --> 00:55:44,300
I want Li to learn
Miyagi karate.

855
00:55:46,385 --> 00:55:50,806
Li means to me what you
meant to Sensei Miyagi.

856
00:55:55,394 --> 00:55:58,646
I'm sorry, Mr. Han. I
wish I could help you.

857
00:55:58,647 --> 00:56:01,024
You will.

858
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:03,277
-I can't.
-You can.

859
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:05,780
You're not listening to me.

860
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:08,032
I hear you clear and loud.

861
00:56:09,325 --> 00:56:11,577
I... I'm not coming to New York.

862
00:56:12,745 --> 00:56:14,580
I see you in the Big Apple.

863
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:25,006
My uncle entered me
into the 5 Boroughs.

864
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:28,134
You're gonna fight the most dangerous
karate tournament in the entire city?

865
00:56:28,135 --> 00:56:29,469
Don't try to talk me out of it.

866
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:32,223
No, dude, that's so awesome.
We're gonna destroy that guy.

867
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:35,141
Watch out, New York! Li
Fong's gonna kick your ass!

868
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:36,810
Okay. Shut up.

869
00:56:36,811 --> 00:56:40,397
I don't even know karate yet. I don't
have a place to practice either.

870
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:43,484
Okay, well, we can
figure this out. Um...

871
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:47,905
How do you feel about pigeons?

872
00:56:48,823 --> 00:56:51,282
These are homing pigeons.

873
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:54,953
Some kids inherit trust funds
and Lamborghinis, but me?

874
00:56:54,954 --> 00:56:56,037
I get this.

875
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:58,248
The world-famous
Fetterman Gardens.

876
00:56:58,249 --> 00:57:00,417
Welcome to your new gym.

877
00:57:07,216 --> 00:57:08,217
Yes.

878
00:57:13,264 --> 00:57:15,224
Cock-a-doodle-do!

879
00:57:15,891 --> 00:57:17,935
Morning. Wake up. Time to train.

880
00:57:20,646 --> 00:57:22,148
When did you get back?

881
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:26,442
Huh. It's no Han
School of Kung Fu,

882
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:27,736
but this will do nicely.

883
00:57:30,906 --> 00:57:32,323
Focus!

884
00:57:32,324 --> 00:57:33,825
Get low.

885
00:57:33,826 --> 00:57:36,745
Log. Helps you block.

886
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:45,880
Even out. Focus.

887
00:57:46,964 --> 00:57:50,008
Jacket on, jacket
off. More fling...

888
00:57:50,009 --> 00:57:52,260
...less toss.

889
00:57:56,098 --> 00:57:59,142
Where did you
come up with this?

890
00:57:59,143 --> 00:58:00,643
Ancient kung fu proverb.

891
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:02,813
-Make do with what you have.
-Okay.

892
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,856
<i>I know why you're here.</i>

893
00:58:04,857 --> 00:58:07,025
-I know you know.
-Then you know I don't approve.

894
00:58:07,026 --> 00:58:08,402
I know.

895
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:19,370
Get up!

896
00:58:20,456 --> 00:58:21,623
Jacket on, jacket off.

897
00:58:21,624 --> 00:58:24,264
My problem is that I see
Bo every time I fight.

898
00:58:26,712 --> 00:58:27,962
You still need to focus.

899
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:29,798
I'm trying to focus!

900
00:58:30,382 --> 00:58:33,051
Jacket on, jacket off
will help that too.

901
00:58:37,473 --> 00:58:38,641
Go.

902
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:42,560
So we're just supposed
to let him fight?

903
00:58:42,561 --> 00:58:45,730
It is not about fighting.
It is about not giving up.

904
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:46,982
Not just for <i>Xiao</i> Li.

905
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:49,777
For both of you.

906
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,823
-Huh? Huh?
-Turn around. Focus.

907
00:59:01,789 --> 00:59:03,457
One hot dog, please.

908
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,919
-One with the works.
-Oh. Thank you.

909
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,588
Hey, can I get one of
those too? Ketchup, relish.

910
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:12,257
-Thank you very much.
-Here you go.

911
00:59:12,258 --> 00:59:14,301
No. Hot dog is bad for you.

912
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:17,387
-Oh. No problem.
-Never mind.

913
00:59:17,388 --> 00:59:19,139
Hurry up. More training.

914
00:59:27,314 --> 00:59:28,399
Get low.

915
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:40,326
Okay, stop, stop, stop, stop.

916
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:41,869
Okay. I know, focus, focus.

917
00:59:43,872 --> 00:59:44,873
Oh.

918
00:59:46,166 --> 00:59:47,709
That was too wide a stance.

919
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:50,921
Karate is more upright. We
step toward our opponent.

920
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:53,881
Sensei LaRusso.

921
00:59:53,882 --> 00:59:55,091
Han <i>Shifu</i>.

922
01:00:00,472 --> 01:00:01,639
What brings you to New York?

923
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,560
Don't do that. You
knew I was coming.

924
01:00:05,394 --> 01:00:07,563
<i>Xiao</i> Li, meet Sensei LaRusso.

925
01:00:09,565 --> 01:00:10,607
It's an honor.

926
01:00:11,317 --> 01:00:12,609
This is interesting.

927
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:16,279
You do realize it's impossible
for a student to master karate

928
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,448
in only one week, don't you?

929
01:00:18,282 --> 01:00:20,617
You have not seen
student in action yet.

930
01:00:24,663 --> 01:00:27,207
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Good, good, good, good, good.

931
01:00:29,501 --> 01:00:30,710
A week might work.

932
01:00:30,711 --> 01:00:33,130
Our traditions are
rooted in history.

933
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:36,674
You have a very good
foundation of kung fu.

934
01:00:36,675 --> 01:00:39,844
But to win the 5 Boroughs,
you're gonna need karate.

935
01:00:39,845 --> 01:00:42,056
We're gonna keep the movements
simple to start, okay?

936
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:44,349
Front block.

937
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:46,560
-Then you go side kick.
-Side kick.

938
01:00:47,186 --> 01:00:48,478
Nice. Front punch.

939
01:00:48,479 --> 01:00:49,854
Front punch.

940
01:00:49,855 --> 01:00:51,189
Good. Han <i>Shifu</i>?

941
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:53,024
-Yes?
-Attack on three.

942
01:00:53,025 --> 01:00:54,108
-Me?
-Mm-hmm.

943
01:00:54,109 --> 01:00:55,819
And one...

944
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:01,116
I said simple.

945
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:03,659
This is simple.

946
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:06,621
These are new techniques. Don't you
think you should take it easy on him?

947
01:01:06,622 --> 01:01:10,542
The opponent will not take
it easy on him. Why should I?

948
01:01:11,627 --> 01:01:12,919
He's okay.

949
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:15,797
You asked me to
teach him karate.

950
01:01:15,798 --> 01:01:18,884
-Okay, first learn stand, then learn fly.
-God.

951
01:01:19,968 --> 01:01:21,636
There's two of 'em.

952
01:01:25,516 --> 01:01:27,058
Oh, my shoulder.

953
01:01:27,059 --> 01:01:28,143
Again.

954
01:01:28,811 --> 01:01:30,269
I already got the point, Sensei.

955
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:32,439
We don't fight for
points. We fight to kill.

956
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:40,823
Strike. Hi-yah!

957
01:01:42,366 --> 01:01:43,367
{\an8}Breathe.

958
01:01:44,118 --> 01:01:45,118
{\an8}Replace.

959
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:46,286
{\an8}Hey, Li!

960
01:01:48,497 --> 01:01:53,877
So, this is what they
mean by city views.

961
01:01:55,504 --> 01:01:56,755
You want to talk about it?

962
01:01:57,423 --> 01:02:01,717
We kinda got in, like, a fight, and
now she's not talking to me anymore.

963
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:02,969
In life...

964
01:02:05,305 --> 01:02:07,557
...you have only one question:

965
01:02:07,558 --> 01:02:09,476
Is it worth fighting for?

966
01:02:12,104 --> 01:02:13,355
She is.

967
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:15,940
Thank you for your patience.

968
01:02:15,941 --> 01:02:18,110
Hi. You guys ready to order?

969
01:02:18,819 --> 01:02:20,446
We got a pie for Broadway.

970
01:02:22,573 --> 01:02:24,158
What, you want me
to ride the bike?

971
01:02:24,825 --> 01:02:25,993
Come on.

972
01:02:41,884 --> 01:02:43,135
Hello?

973
01:02:43,635 --> 01:02:45,971
Did somebody order a pizza?

974
01:02:46,805 --> 01:02:49,640
Hi. Yeah, it was... it was me.

975
01:02:49,641 --> 01:02:51,267
Flute of bubbly for the lady.

976
01:02:51,268 --> 01:02:52,685
-Mmm.
-Mmm.

977
01:02:52,686 --> 01:02:55,772
Pepsi. Pairs well
with pepperoni. Yeah.

978
01:02:57,483 --> 01:02:59,026
Give him a chance.

979
01:03:06,867 --> 01:03:10,579
So, this is the new gym, huh?

980
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:16,042
Yeah. Yeah, this is,
uh, Fetterman Gardens,

981
01:03:16,043 --> 01:03:19,213
where karate legends are made.

982
01:03:22,633 --> 01:03:25,676
You know you don't
have to do this, Li.

983
01:03:25,677 --> 01:03:26,845
You don't have to fight.

984
01:03:27,888 --> 01:03:29,472
Yes, I do.

985
01:03:29,473 --> 01:03:31,307
No, not for my dad.

986
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:34,061
And not for me.

987
01:03:34,895 --> 01:03:35,979
I know.

988
01:03:37,022 --> 01:03:38,315
I'm doing this for me.

989
01:03:40,567 --> 01:03:42,902
And plus, if I win, that'd be
pretty cool for everyone, right?

990
01:03:45,447 --> 01:03:46,990
Give us all that fresh start.

991
01:03:50,953 --> 01:03:52,495
Are you sure?

992
01:03:52,496 --> 01:03:53,580
Yeah.

993
01:03:57,876 --> 01:03:59,545
Do I have you in my corner?

994
01:04:03,215 --> 01:04:06,552
There's just, uh,
one problem. I, um...

995
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:09,512
I think I'm falling
in love with Alan.

996
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:16,435
Yeah. Yeah.

997
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:17,812
<i>♪ The one... ♪</i>

998
01:04:17,813 --> 01:04:19,272
I knew this plan would backfire.

999
01:04:23,026 --> 01:04:27,446
<i>♪ I never wanna hear you say ♪</i>

1000
01:04:27,447 --> 01:04:31,867
<i>♪ I want it that way ♪</i>

1001
01:04:34,496 --> 01:04:35,872
<i>♪ Tell me why ♪</i>

1002
01:04:43,297 --> 01:04:49,010
New York, are you ready?

1003
01:04:49,011 --> 01:04:51,429
Welcome to the 5 Boroughs,

1004
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:54,056
where the top brawlers
battle it out to see

1005
01:04:54,057 --> 01:04:57,351
who's the best of the best.

1006
01:04:57,352 --> 01:05:00,229
And whoever that man
is gets 50 grand.

1007
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:03,649
<i>Mmm. Matches are to
eight points or KO.</i>

1008
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:06,611
<i>Body shots are one point.
Head shots are two.</i>

1009
01:05:06,612 --> 01:05:08,530
-Fighters.
-You got this.

1010
01:05:09,698 --> 01:05:10,948
<i>And here we go.</i>

1011
01:05:10,949 --> 01:05:13,826
{\an8}<i>For the first round
of the 5 Boroughs,</i>

1012
01:05:13,827 --> 01:05:17,288
{\an8}<i>Li Fong versus Buddha Stevens.</i>

1013
01:05:17,289 --> 01:05:18,915
Bow to each other.

1014
01:05:20,542 --> 01:05:22,462
-Ready.
-Get him, Buddha!

1015
01:05:26,006 --> 01:05:27,006
<i>Hajime!</i>

1016
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:30,509
-<i>We've got one to the midsection already.</i>
-One point.

1017
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:32,345
<i>That is one point.
Buddha Stevens.</i>

1018
01:05:32,346 --> 01:05:33,804
Welcome to the 5 Boroughs.

1019
01:05:33,805 --> 01:05:35,264
<i>Let's see if Fong can recover.</i>

1020
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:36,642
Keep going, man!

1021
01:05:42,272 --> 01:05:44,106
-Two!
<i>-What a head kick.</i>

1022
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:47,778
{\an8}Knockout. Winner!

1023
01:05:49,363 --> 01:05:50,696
Happy to be here.

1024
01:05:50,697 --> 01:05:51,990
<i>Tough luck, Buddha!</i>

1025
01:05:57,496 --> 01:06:00,247
<i>Yama-zuki</i>. Punching
block. Stronger base.

1026
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:03,334
Windmill block more dynamic.

1027
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:18,349
-Hey, everything is kung fu.
-Yeah, well... No...

1028
01:06:18,350 --> 01:06:20,477
What happened to "two
branches, one tree"?

1029
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:24,564
One branch stronger
than the other.

1030
01:06:26,024 --> 01:06:30,570
{\an8}<i>Round two. 5 Boroughs. Li
Fong versus Queens Tornado.</i>

1031
01:06:31,697 --> 01:06:33,323
<i>That's the Yama-zuki
punch block.</i>

1032
01:06:35,659 --> 01:06:36,784
Stop!

1033
01:06:36,785 --> 01:06:37,911
Winner!

1034
01:06:38,704 --> 01:06:40,744
-Next.
<i>-Easy win for Conor Day.</i>

1035
01:06:42,124 --> 01:06:44,291
<i>Weather update. Tornado down.</i>

1036
01:06:44,292 --> 01:06:46,628
-<i>Li Fong moving on.</i>
-Winner!

1037
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:50,005
-That's new.
-Do you like it?

1038
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:51,299
Yeah.

1039
01:06:52,175 --> 01:06:55,678
-Hey! There he is!
-Who hired this guy?

1040
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:57,555
Her fault.

1041
01:06:57,556 --> 01:06:58,681
What's all this?

1042
01:06:58,682 --> 01:07:01,435
Congratulations. You made
it on the wall of fame.

1043
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:09,734
Anything else I should know?

1044
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:19,160
<i>This is a glorified sparring
session for Conor Day!</i>

1045
01:07:20,287 --> 01:07:22,997
<i>Wow. Making short work
of the Lion's Mane.</i>

1046
01:07:22,998 --> 01:07:24,165
Winner!

1047
01:07:24,166 --> 01:07:26,585
<i>That's it. Conor Day
advances to the final.</i>

1048
01:07:32,924 --> 01:07:34,842
Yeah! There we go.

1049
01:07:36,678 --> 01:07:39,097
<i>Windmill block by Li Fong.</i>

1050
01:07:42,809 --> 01:07:45,895
-<i>Lights out, Barrett!</i>
-Winner!

1051
01:07:45,896 --> 01:07:48,940
<i>Li Fong is moving
on to the finals.</i>

1052
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:56,656
Yo, boys.

1053
01:08:01,203 --> 01:08:02,621
Hold up, kid.

1054
01:08:03,497 --> 01:08:04,873
Sensei! Look out!

1055
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:09,002
Li! Watch out!

1056
01:08:10,629 --> 01:08:11,630
Li!

1057
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:18,213
Mr. Han, watch out!

1058
01:08:20,055 --> 01:08:21,139
You want some?

1059
01:08:22,933 --> 01:08:23,933
Let's go.

1060
01:08:23,934 --> 01:08:27,520
{\an8}<i>That's it. Li "Stuffed Crust"
Fong advances to the final,</i>

1061
01:08:27,521 --> 01:08:29,605
{\an8}<i>where he'll match
up with Conor Day</i>

1062
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:33,943
{\an8}<i>one week from today atop the roof of
a skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan.</i>

1063
01:08:33,944 --> 01:08:35,986
<i>It's a showdown in the sky</i>

1064
01:08:35,987 --> 01:08:38,698
<i>where one fighter
will win $50,000.</i>

1065
01:08:40,992 --> 01:08:42,953
So, uh, how's the
tournament going?

1066
01:08:44,162 --> 01:08:46,747
Good. Just missing one thing.

1067
01:08:52,754 --> 01:08:55,714
Your uncle says this Conor
kid fights like a tiger.

1068
01:08:58,218 --> 01:09:00,344
I have plenty of experience
with opponents like that.

1069
01:09:04,015 --> 01:09:06,350
You know the best way
to defeat a tiger?

1070
01:09:06,351 --> 01:09:07,977
Be a bigger tiger?

1071
01:09:07,978 --> 01:09:09,436
Set a trap.

1072
01:09:12,941 --> 01:09:15,860
Use your opponent's
aggression against him.

1073
01:09:15,861 --> 01:09:18,571
No, no, no, no, no,
no. Better like this.

1074
01:09:18,572 --> 01:09:19,781
Come.

1075
01:09:20,949 --> 01:09:22,783
Hold on, hold on!

1076
01:09:22,784 --> 01:09:24,326
Better like this.

1077
01:09:24,327 --> 01:09:27,788
Maybe in kung fu.
But in karate...

1078
01:09:27,789 --> 01:09:29,040
Ready?

1079
01:09:31,877 --> 01:09:34,879
There was a weird
noise in my hip.

1080
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:37,464
There was a weird
noise in my hip.

1081
01:09:37,465 --> 01:09:43,178
-Punch! Jacket off!
-No, no, no! Come on!

1082
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:44,263
Ancient way.

1083
01:09:44,264 --> 01:09:46,724
Yeah, I'm just gonna stay here
for a second. It's kinda nice.

1084
01:09:46,725 --> 01:09:49,311
-But in the Valley...
-Just give me a second!

1085
01:09:51,897 --> 01:09:53,188
-Miyagi way.
-Ow.

1086
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:55,065
I show you this.

1087
01:09:55,066 --> 01:09:57,151
No, no, no, guys.

1088
01:09:57,152 --> 01:09:59,570
In Brooklyn, this is
considered assault.

1089
01:10:01,323 --> 01:10:02,616
He's a good student.

1090
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:05,076
He's had a good teacher.

1091
01:10:06,286 --> 01:10:08,913
Teacher only as good
as his students.

1092
01:10:08,914 --> 01:10:10,749
Sensei Miyagi taught me that.

1093
01:10:12,167 --> 01:10:13,293
I miss him.

1094
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:18,255
Every time I have the chance to
pass on a piece of his legacy,

1095
01:10:18,256 --> 01:10:21,635
it's never the wrong choice.

1096
01:10:29,976 --> 01:10:31,227
What do you call that?

1097
01:10:31,853 --> 01:10:32,896
Oh. Uh...

1098
01:10:33,772 --> 01:10:37,232
It's <i>fēi lóng tuǐ</i>. It's Dragon Kick.
It's my brother's move, actually.

1099
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:38,318
You gonna use it?

1100
01:10:40,362 --> 01:10:43,572
I tried it once on Conor already.
He countered it just like that.

1101
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:45,532
He saw it coming. Knocked
me down when I landed.

1102
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:48,202
-That's perfect.
-What do you mean? It didn't work.

1103
01:10:48,203 --> 01:10:49,955
That's how we're
trapping our tiger.

1104
01:10:51,164 --> 01:10:53,374
Han <i>Shifu,</i> I have an idea.

1105
01:10:53,375 --> 01:10:54,668
What idea?

1106
01:10:55,627 --> 01:10:57,253
What did you tell him? Huh?

1107
01:10:59,172 --> 01:11:01,090
Conor will be expecting
the Dragon Kick,

1108
01:11:01,091 --> 01:11:03,676
so we'll use it as
bait to lure him in.

1109
01:11:03,677 --> 01:11:06,345
You need to learn to drop low
enough to avoid Conor's kick,

1110
01:11:06,346 --> 01:11:08,973
leaving him vulnerable.
Then you strike.

1111
01:11:08,974 --> 01:11:11,350
Right. It's the third
move for the Dragon Kick.

1112
01:11:11,351 --> 01:11:13,143
He won't see it coming.
This is our tiger trap.

1113
01:11:13,144 --> 01:11:15,813
Wait, so you want me to
drop low under that thing?

1114
01:11:15,814 --> 01:11:17,022
You're gonna kick through it.

1115
01:11:17,023 --> 01:11:18,357
-Kick through it.
-Yep.

1116
01:11:18,358 --> 01:11:19,693
It's kind of impossible.

1117
01:11:20,485 --> 01:11:21,945
Have at it.

1118
01:11:24,656 --> 01:11:26,240
Great. Now get under the kick.

1119
01:11:26,241 --> 01:11:28,660
-Ow!
-Ooh. Hey, you okay?

1120
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:31,120
You gotta get lower.

1121
01:11:31,121 --> 01:11:33,622
Life knocks you
down, get back up.

1122
01:11:33,623 --> 01:11:34,833
Yeah.

1123
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:39,420
I discovered this going through
some of Mr. Miyagi's things.

1124
01:11:39,421 --> 01:11:44,216
I think it represents the
history between the two families.

1125
01:11:44,217 --> 01:11:46,093
See, two branches,

1126
01:11:46,094 --> 01:11:47,470
-one tree.
-One tree.

1127
01:11:48,388 --> 01:11:49,471
This is why I came to train you,

1128
01:11:49,472 --> 01:11:51,807
so you could carry these
traditions into the future

1129
01:11:51,808 --> 01:11:53,225
and remember what
you're fighting for.

1130
01:11:55,562 --> 01:11:56,855
It's yours.

1131
01:12:00,108 --> 01:12:01,109
Thank you, Sensei.

1132
01:12:06,197 --> 01:12:07,532
Hi-yah!

1133
01:12:11,911 --> 01:12:13,496
Good. Here you go.

1134
01:12:14,664 --> 01:12:16,874
You gotta go faster. Drop lower.

1135
01:12:16,875 --> 01:12:18,293
Stop hitting your head.

1136
01:12:19,169 --> 01:12:20,169
Yeah.

1137
01:12:20,170 --> 01:12:21,963
How much longer is
this gonna go on for?

1138
01:12:28,053 --> 01:12:30,304
How is this helping?

1139
01:12:30,305 --> 01:12:31,722
It's strengthening your quads.

1140
01:12:33,016 --> 01:12:36,977
<i>♪ If you want my body

1141

-Whoo! Hold on tight.
-Easy, easy, easy.

1145
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:48,822
Hey, hey. Slow down.

1146
01:12:48,823 --> 01:12:50,574
-Whoo!

One more! One more!

1153
01:13:23,858 --> 01:13:25,026
Let's go.

1154
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:27,820
It's time.

1155
01:13:27,821 --> 01:13:29,739
Show us the tiger trap.

1156
01:13:33,118 --> 01:13:34,284
Under the kick.

1157
01:13:34,285 --> 01:13:36,037
Sweep the leg. Whoo!

1158
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:40,624
<i>Here we go, the moment
y'all been waiting for.</i>

1159
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:43,293
<i>Sixty stories high
in the Big Apple...</i>

1160
01:13:43,294 --> 01:13:45,588
<i>the greatest city in the world.</i>

1161
01:13:53,555 --> 01:13:55,305
-<i>Xiao</i> Li. I...
-Mom.

1162
01:13:55,306 --> 01:13:57,851
Look, I know what you're gonna
say, but I have to do this.

1163
01:13:58,935 --> 01:14:00,228
I know.

1164
01:14:02,397 --> 01:14:04,232
And you won't be doing it alone.

1165
01:14:14,826 --> 01:14:16,369
Bo would be so proud of you.

1166
01:14:19,998 --> 01:14:21,166
I am too.

1167
01:14:28,256 --> 01:14:29,923
Now go kick his ass.

1168
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:55,158
<i>Xiao</i> Li, ready?

1169
01:14:56,117 --> 01:14:57,327
Almost.

1170
01:14:58,203 --> 01:14:59,454
One more thing.

1171
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,210
Sensei.

1172
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:19,807
Two branches.

1173
01:15:20,391 --> 01:15:21,643
One tree.

1174
01:15:58,429 --> 01:16:00,806
<i>By the way of Beijing, China,</i>

1175
01:16:00,807 --> 01:16:03,141
<i>fighting out of
moneymaking Manhattan,</i>

1176
01:16:03,142 --> 01:16:07,605
<i>we got Li "Stuffed Crust" Fong!</i>

1177
01:16:21,077 --> 01:16:22,704
Go get him, <i>Shifu</i>.

1178
01:16:28,668 --> 01:16:30,460
<i>Out of Demolition Dojo...</i>

1179
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:32,254
We are trapping a tiger tonight.

1180
01:16:32,255 --> 01:16:36,758
<i>...the reigning, the
defending 5 Boroughs champ,</i>

1181
01:16:36,759 --> 01:16:41,973
<i>Conor D-D-D-Day!</i>

1182
01:16:43,725 --> 01:16:45,225
<i>Once again, here
are the rules.</i>

1183
01:16:45,226 --> 01:16:47,227
<i>Eight points or KO,</i>

1184
01:16:47,228 --> 01:16:50,272
<i>body shots are one point, and
head shots are two points.</i>

1185
01:16:50,273 --> 01:16:53,358
<i>And of course, if you
get knocked out...</i>

1186
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:55,153
There's nowhere to go, Beijing.

1187
01:16:58,448 --> 01:16:59,449
I'm not going anywhere.

1188
01:17:00,408 --> 01:17:01,409
Fighters.

1189
01:17:09,959 --> 01:17:11,794
Ooh!

1190
01:17:17,842 --> 01:17:19,562
Demolition in the house!

1191
01:17:22,972 --> 01:17:25,474
<i>Side kick by Fong.
Slipped by Conor Day.</i>

1192
01:17:28,227 --> 01:17:30,103
<i>Spinning hook
kick to the face.</i>

1193
01:17:30,104 --> 01:17:32,731
-<i>Ooh! Day looks a lot faster in there.</i>
-Ooh!

1194
01:17:32,732 --> 01:17:34,108
Two points.

1195
01:17:50,124 --> 01:17:52,751
<i>Li Fong, having a really
hard time finding Conor Day.</i>

1196
01:17:55,630 --> 01:17:57,589
<i>Side kick to the midsection.</i>

1197
01:17:57,590 --> 01:18:00,467
-<i>Conor Day, admiring his work.</i>
-One point!

1198
01:18:00,468 --> 01:18:01,676
<i>Li Fong takes flight.</i>

1199
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:05,180
<i>Conor Day grounds him
with a one-arm body slam.</i>

1200
01:18:05,181 --> 01:18:06,307
You can't do that!

1201
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:09,852
<i>Down goes Fong and the ref!</i>

1202
01:18:18,528 --> 01:18:20,654
<i>Xiao</i> Li, get up.
Get back in there.

1203
01:18:20,655 --> 01:18:22,239
Come on, Li.

1204
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:23,573
Fight back.

1205
01:18:23,574 --> 01:18:25,409
<i>This is turning out
to be a wipe out.</i>

1206
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:28,538
Come on, Li.

1207
01:18:29,288 --> 01:18:30,790
There you go.

1208
01:18:46,013 --> 01:18:47,639
Stay balanced.

1209
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:48,724
Stay focused.

1210
01:18:54,188 --> 01:18:55,272
<i>Block by Fong.</i>

1211
01:18:55,273 --> 01:18:56,857
<i>Block by Fong. Block.</i>

1212
01:18:56,858 --> 01:18:59,484
<i>Block by Fong. And
here comes Li Fong.</i>

1213
01:18:59,485 --> 01:19:00,736
-Yes.
-Yeah.

1214
01:19:07,618 --> 01:19:09,494
-<i>Point, Fong!</i>
-That's our move.

1215
01:19:09,495 --> 01:19:11,830
-<i>Classic one-inch punch!</i>
-One point!

1216
01:19:11,831 --> 01:19:13,498
<i>Li Fong is finally
on the board.</i>

1217
01:19:13,499 --> 01:19:15,793
Can you still fight?

1218
01:19:18,629 --> 01:19:21,424
<i>Okay, Li Fong not
afraid to go toe-to-toe.</i>

1219
01:19:22,258 --> 01:19:23,259
One point!

1220
01:19:26,804 --> 01:19:28,055
Nice!

1221
01:19:28,848 --> 01:19:30,057
One point!

1222
01:19:38,858 --> 01:19:40,275
<i>Ooh!</i>

1223
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:42,361
<i>Reverse-roundhouse kick.</i>

1224
01:19:42,862 --> 01:19:44,613
-I taught him that.
-No, I taught him that.

1225
01:19:44,614 --> 01:19:45,697
Two points!

1226
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:48,408
<i>Two points for the kick
to the face. It's tied up.</i>

1227
01:19:48,409 --> 01:19:51,245
<i>This is the fight now! We
got a fight on our hands!</i>

1228
01:20:02,590 --> 01:20:04,800
<i>Ooh! Fong counters.</i>

1229
01:20:08,763 --> 01:20:09,889
<i>Point, Day.</i>

1230
01:20:13,017 --> 01:20:15,811
<i>Point, Fong! He
has taken the lead.</i>

1231
01:20:18,898 --> 01:20:20,983
<i>Ooh! Point, Fong!</i>

1232
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,030
-Ooh!
-Two points!

1233
01:20:26,614 --> 01:20:29,783
<i>That's a head shot. That's
a head shot for Conor Day.</i>

1234
01:20:29,784 --> 01:20:30,909
<i>That's two points!</i>

1235
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:33,328
-Hey. Stop. Stay there.
-Hey. No, hey. Hey.

1236
01:20:33,329 --> 01:20:35,038
No, no, no. It counts.

1237
01:20:35,039 --> 01:20:36,666
-One, two...
-<i>Xiao</i> Li!

1238
01:20:38,251 --> 01:20:39,252
...three...

1239
01:20:45,174 --> 01:20:47,008
-Get up, kid!
-...four...

1240
01:20:48,511 --> 01:20:49,678
Come on, Li!

1241
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:51,054
...five...

1242
01:20:51,055 --> 01:20:53,348
<i>Xiao</i> Li! Get up.

1243
01:20:53,349 --> 01:20:58,938
...six, seven, eight, nine...

1244
01:21:00,022 --> 01:21:01,523
-Yes!
-Yes!

1245
01:21:01,524 --> 01:21:03,776
Let's go, Li! Come on.

1246
01:21:09,073 --> 01:21:11,075
Come on, Li! Kick his ass!

1247
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:16,371
-Come on, Li!
-Let's go!

1248
01:21:16,372 --> 01:21:18,040
-You can do this!
-Let's go!

1249
01:21:18,833 --> 01:21:20,584
<i>All tied up at seven.</i>

1250
01:21:20,585 --> 01:21:22,920
<i>Next point wins it.</i>

1251
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:52,325
Let's go, Conor!

1252
01:22:19,060 --> 01:22:20,936
Oh!

1253
01:22:31,447 --> 01:22:34,282
<i>Point, Fong. That
is it. Point, Fong.</i>

1254
01:22:34,283 --> 01:22:36,117
<i>It is all over.</i>

1255
01:22:36,118 --> 01:22:39,537
<i>8-7, Li Fong!</i>

1256
01:22:39,538 --> 01:22:43,084
<i>Your new 5 Borough Champion.</i>

1257
01:22:43,918 --> 01:22:44,919
Whoa!

1258
01:22:50,675 --> 01:22:52,802
<i>Xiao</i> Li!

1259
01:23:07,149 --> 01:23:08,317
Li!

1260
01:23:29,714 --> 01:23:31,339
Winner!

1261
01:23:34,218 --> 01:23:36,679
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1262
01:23:48,983 --> 01:23:50,151
<i>Xiao</i> Li!

1263
01:23:53,821 --> 01:23:55,030
You did it!

1264
01:23:59,827 --> 01:24:00,910
We did it.

1265
01:24:00,911 --> 01:24:02,163
Yes!

1266
01:24:11,088 --> 01:24:12,089
Li!

1267
01:24:13,883 --> 01:24:15,884
Hey, hey. Uh, my hand. My hand.

1268
01:24:15,885 --> 01:24:17,970
Okay, all right, all right.
That's enough of that.

1269
01:24:18,554 --> 01:24:20,973
Whoa!

1270
01:24:26,854 --> 01:24:29,022
Stuffed Crust! Stuffed Crust!

1271
01:24:29,023 --> 01:24:33,319
Stuffed Crust! Stuffed Crust!

1272
01:24:56,008 --> 01:24:57,635
Thanks for waiting, everybody.

1273
01:25:00,429 --> 01:25:02,765
-We got two Sicilians and a stuffed crust.
-I got it.

1274
01:25:03,808 --> 01:25:05,767
Finally came around on
the stuffed crust, huh?

1275
01:25:05,768 --> 01:25:06,893
Limited-time offer.

1276
01:25:06,894 --> 01:25:08,770
I mean, you saved the shop.
It's the least I could do.

1277
01:25:10,314 --> 01:25:12,733
-Oh. Looks good.
-Mmm.

1278
01:25:13,943 --> 01:25:15,569
We're gonna miss you
around here, <i>Shifu.</i>

1279
01:25:16,403 --> 01:25:18,113
-Wrong hand.
-Ugh.

1280
01:25:18,697 --> 01:25:21,032
Come visit Beijing. We
open third location.

1281
01:25:21,033 --> 01:25:22,660
You got the money,
I got the time.

1282
01:25:26,539 --> 01:25:29,082
Oh! Oh-oh-oh-oh.

1283
01:25:29,083 --> 01:25:30,708
Oh!

1284
01:25:30,709 --> 01:25:32,837
{\an8}We got a delivery for you, boss.

1285
01:25:37,258 --> 01:25:38,925
{\an8}This delivery is going where?

1286
01:25:41,846 --> 01:25:44,097
-Yeah?
-Uh, pizza for a Daniel LaRusso.

1287
01:25:44,098 --> 01:25:45,558
I didn't order a pizza.

1288
01:25:46,934 --> 01:25:49,228
"Thank you, Sensei."

1289
01:25:54,692 --> 01:25:57,653
"If you ever need my help,
you know where to find me."

1290
01:26:03,158 --> 01:26:05,577
"By the way, you
owe $1100 plus tip."

1291
01:26:05,578 --> 01:26:07,496
Li Fong.

1292
01:26:08,205 --> 01:26:10,207
All right, wise guy.

1293
01:26:13,794 --> 01:26:15,670
Hey, Johnny, you gotta try
this pizza from New York.

1294
01:26:15,671 --> 01:26:18,673
-It's the best I've ever had.
-Why would you ship pizza from New York?

1295
01:26:18,674 --> 01:26:20,466
Everybody knows the
best pizza's in Encino.

1296
01:26:20,467 --> 01:26:22,511
No, there's no comparison.
I'm telling ya.

1297
01:26:23,929 --> 01:26:25,805
-Wait, dude, that's it.
-What?

1298
01:26:25,806 --> 01:26:28,016
-Our new business idea.
-What are you talking about?

1299
01:26:28,017 --> 01:26:30,977
We open our own pizza place.
We call it Miyagi-Dough.

1300
01:26:30,978 --> 01:26:32,145
Uh, no, no, no, no, no.

1301
01:26:32,146 --> 01:26:35,148
No, get it? Like Miyagi-Do,
but dough, like pizza dough.

1302
01:26:35,149 --> 01:26:37,442
Y-Yeah, yeah, I get
it. It's disrespectful.

1303
01:26:37,443 --> 01:26:39,277
-To pizza?
-To Mr. Miyagi.

1304
01:26:39,278 --> 01:26:40,612
Mr. Miyagi didn't like pizza?

1305
01:26:40,613 --> 01:26:43,115
Yeah, Johnny, you know what?
I'm gonna heat the pizza.

1306
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:46,118
Miyagi-Dough.

1307
01:26:46,702 --> 01:26:48,245
Pepperoni's your best defense.

1308
01:26:49,079 --> 01:26:50,538
Miyagi-Dough.

1309
01:26:50,539 --> 01:26:52,917
Slice first, slice
hard, no anchovies.

1310
01:26:53,876 --> 01:26:55,878
This is a billion-dollar
idea, LaRusso.

1311
01:26:56,754 --> 01:26:59,005
Miyagi-Dough. Miyagi-Dough.

1312
01:26:59,006 --> 01:27:00,924
